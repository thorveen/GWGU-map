"Table 8. Current estimates of seabird breeding populations at colonies in the northern Strait of Georgia as of 2022.",,,,,,,,,
"Estimates are numbers of breeding pairs except for numbers in parentheses and totals in the “All species” column, which",,,,,,,,,
"are numbers of individuals. Numbers in parentheses, given mainly for Pigeon Guillemots, are numbers of birds counted",,,,,,,,,
"around colonies, likely include non-breeding birds, and thus are not reliable estimates of actual breeding populations. See",,,,,,,,,
